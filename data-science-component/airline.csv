2,Another worse flight experience PK6754 Date of travel 8th November ,I was very happy when I planned my vacation and thought to surprise my family but unfortunately when I went to the airport I found out flight is delayed for 4 hours Flight took off around 6pm Pakistan time so it was not surprise anymore because I have to inform my family members as I was arriving very late  at night Secondly no social distance was maintained and 777 was totally full with passengers Third thing Air condition was on its full speed and it was chilling in the plane cannot understand that in summer AC doesnt work or they dont switched it ON and in winters it was on full speed I requested Cabin crew couple of times and every time they told me the same answer that yes we will reduce now but did nothing Finally I took out my jacket from my hand carry luggage and managed to cover myself for the rest of the flight duration Cabin crew Age was almost the age of my parents and Male cabin crew specially was so unprofessional looks like they are at that stage of their career when they dont give a damn about anything like take it or leave itAt the end my I would clearly mention that my purpose is not to disregard my National carrier but until when these things will be stopped I would really request Mr Arshad Malik to save our national carrier from this disaster service Look into these kind of matters why flight is delayed every single time we travel with PIA Why Cabin crew are so unprofessional Why we cant be proud of our National airline Being honest this is my last time I travelled with PIA and will stick to my decision until these kind of stupid issues will not be resolved ,abdulhaseeb346,en,1,Very Bad

36,Worst Possible Hospitality,I am really sad to write this review After watching all these promotional content and  improvement projection from Pakistan International Airlines and Air Marshal Arshad Mahmood Malik I was really excited to fly with my very first PIA flight My trip was from Abu Dhabi to Islamabad PK 296 Lahore to Karachi PK 313 and then Karachi to Abu Dhabi PK 4222 We were planning to go to attend my best friends wedding My friends and I never flew before with PIA for the obvious reasons bad performance and terrible customer handling in the past Unfortunately this boat drowned leaving very bad impressionsI am a frequent traveler and a Travel Photo blogger ref travelschahI do not like to write negative about services but I always love to share my experiencesDuring the flight from Abu Dhabi when I entered in the aircraft it had a worst smell in aircraft My flight was booked but neither anyone mentioned to me that on domestic flight baggage is reduced nor in the email My baggage was as per my international flight allowance Which was reduced to 20kg without my knowledge If I am flying from Abu Dhabi to Islamabad with 29kg of baggage where I am supposed to leave the rest of 9 kg to fly with your unscheduled flight But at the check in counter Mr Haider misbehaved and literally shouted on me I was impressed with such of wonderful PIA hospitality Then I was handed over to Mr Gondal who took me to ticketing section and without resolving issue left me there with Mr Ali Furqan ticketing guy Mr Gondal asked Mr Furqan to check the ticket and confirm if I am not wrong Mr Furqan informed Mr Gondal that fault is not from my side it is their ticketing issue from Abu Dhabi Mr Gondal informed me he cannot help me out and I will have yo talk to Terminal Managar Mr Chaudhry They informed Mr Chaudhry that its fault from ticketing But Mr Chaudhry said I can apologize the ticketing agencys fault and then clearly refused to help me He was telling me stories how airline is firing people without any justification these days and this is why he cannot provide help to the passengers he need to keep his performance sheet clean I didnt understand how you can prove your performance while leaving passengers devastatedAt the end I had to pay extra for the baggage which was 5800 PKR Not a big deal I came back to the counter and collected my boarding While leaving the check in counter I heard Mr Choudhry talking to a Young lady whos mother was on a wheel chair who also has 7 kg of access baggage that wait on a side he is gonna help her resolving an issue I am sorry for ear dropping here but then I had to interrupt and ask Mr Nice and gentle Choudhry that my access baggage was 4 kilo I had to pay 5800 extra while she has got 7 how you gonna resolve her problem not mine while you are eager to give her favor for nothing and my ticket was a poor performance of your smart ticketing office While talking to Mr Choudhry girl ask me to stay out of THEIR matter But eventually she also had to pay because I was not interested to leave until she receive the same treatment as I hadLeaving the issue behind flight which was supposed to take off at 0800 on 30Dec2019 was rescheduled to 1200 later to 1400 1615 and then 1800 PST It left everyone in frustration too I had asked Mr Choudhry that flight is more than 6 hours delayed now what are the compensations for passengers he angrily said we are giving you lunch what else you want While in departures food was without any thing to drink no water or soft drinks Let me remind you PIA is one of the member signee of The Montreal Convention which reserve the rights of passengers As referenceIn case of flight delay of more than 2 to 4 hours in proportion to flight distance the airline shall serve refreshments  meals to passengers according to time of day and offer communication facilities  hotel accommodation for the night when necessary eg transit passengers  outstation passengers who do not have own accommodation Article D 1225  D14 of ANO001ATCP20I was an outstation passenger and I was not accommodated in anything Which was strange for me No hotel no refreshments Later came the food without water I ask the guy over the reception if he has got some water he said we are out of water go drink from the tap he pointed me towards a water plantWe second part of it When the delay is more than 5 hours and the passenger decides to discontinue his journey with the airline the airline shall offer full refund of the unutilized ticketArticle D 134  D14 of ANO001ATCP20While I was told there is a next flight for you so we can not refund I had my mothers appointment with a doctor at South City Hospital Karachi Thanks to PIA my mother had to miss the appointment because I couldnt make it to Karachi I was so excited to travel with PIA as I am a big supporter of National Institutes But it turned into a worst nightmare At the end I would like to close by addressing CEO PIA Mr Arshad Mahmoud Malik that sir you are struggling with hardware we can understand but what happened to basic customer handling skills Not taught by PIA I am talking about the real basics taught by our parents

59,Fly at your own risk  Airliner not responsible for you luggage  or your life ,PIA  Great people to fly with If survive Step into Pakistani environment right from entering the airlines smiling  welcoming flight person faces ignoring screaming kids in background welcoming passengers to mildly lit spacious cabin with loads of space for overhead luggage  The only airline allowing you to carry 40 kg per person  friendly staff let you carry more if you are lucky Uncomfortable Mucky seats with broken  prehistoric  non functioning tv screens  roughest seat belts  will keep you tied to the seat for your entire journey unless you bursting with pee Served with miniature meals  unlimited refills of mineral water keeps you well hydrated for your entire journey Surviving the whole journey arriving at destination you need to carry a pillow  blanket as you will need to wait for your luggage for indefinite period of time If your lucky enough to recieve your complete luggage  you need atleast a few hours to few days to celebrate  get congratulated  most probably rewarded to survive it all Amongst the unlucky passenger half of our luggage arrived of all non useful boxes  and after waiting for good few hours we were told to leave our contact numbers for the staff to inform us when our rest of luggage arrives without giving us any estimated time the staff advised us to call daily to inquire about our lost luggage Wrapping our kids in plastic shopping bags without any nappies  toddlers clothes scratching our back in the sweaty clothes we travelled we dragged our remaining luggage after been disappointed from the world most notorious unfriendly  non cooperative staff of PIA we went to the Parking to our transport to relax in the car seat straightening our back started our journey through motorway Halfway through recieved the call from my brother in law who was informed by my sister who was informed by mum that she recieved the call from PIA that they found the lost luggage   to come  collect it Turned our way back to airport going through security explaining the situation for unnecessary travel back to airport paying the airport parking charges again went to PIA desk  with grumpy looking people at reception asked us to pop in the back  identify our suitcases which we did  rushed it away to the car to avoid any further risk of damage or loss PS this was international flight We travelled in domestic flight ATR from Islamabad to Lahore  worst torture in my life  with ringing ears  loosing balance after flight ATR should be banned these are not fit for travel unless you want to transfer your prisoners from jail or punishing someone The torture of travelling through ATR domestic flight will make anyone  Believe in God,faheemshah,en,1,Very Bad

62,NOT SO EXECUTIVE ECONOMY,PIA is offering business class seats at the rates of economy class In a bid to reclaim the top spot Pakistan International Airlines PIA is offering a mega deal to its flyers You can enjoy all the comforts of business class including a meal while paying for economy class faresAfter reading above description of executive economy from PIA I upgraded my ticket to execonomy for my return flight from islamabad to dubai at the cost of 27000 pkr on top of what i had already paid for economy ticketLounge at isb airport was acceptable Very disappointed once boarded the plane No audio or visual entertainment  Seat were same as economy with bit of extra legroom onlyNO BUSINESS CLASS SEATSas advertised just a flimsy little curtains dividing front 12 seats from rest of cabin Meals were bit better then economy Staff was good certainly not worth paying for unless you can think of it as a donation to the countryI hope PIA will one day get its act together again,mussafi,en,2,Bad
63,The worst airline in the world in my opinion Dare to travel on this airline at your own risk,This airline on 18 Oct 2019 decided to change the flight time from 2310 hours to 2130 When challenged they said they could do it and when reminded about the Warsaw Convention about international air travel a Dr Yaseen who is allegedly the station head for Pia at Lahore airport stated it did not apply to PIA In any event he refused to even supply accommodation or alternative transport I relinquished my loyalty card to him and said I will not be needing it as I will never travel with this pathetic excuse of a company masquerading as an airline ever again I was wasnt the only one in this predicament The also have the nerve to have Great People to Fly With as their slogan They are anything butI WOULD RECOMMEND WALKING RATHER THAN USE THIS SO CALLED PATHETIC AIRLINEI got a flight the following day with them and there are serious health and safety issues  The aircraft was filthy and in my opinion a breeding ground for various exotic diseases Please see attached photos of toilet the broken seat is fixed with porus duct tape ,K1ANY786,en,1,Very Bad

65,Terrible Passengers Good Crew,PIA is known to be a terrible airline but for me it is no fault of the crew The plane was delayed on the ground in Islamabad due to a technical fault and while the plane was being fixed they served lunch to passengers What was terrible to see was the passengers throwing trash in the aisles and on the floor with no regards for other fellow passengers Most of the passengers were traveling with families and despite the airline offering free seat selection most of them had not availed this option While on board they would then sit anywhere they wanted and not move insisting on sitting with their families Many parents would not stop their children from kicking on other seats etc and would turn on tabletsphones on full volume without headphones for their kids to be entertained Some even changed diapers on the seat and would place the dirty diapers in seat pockets stinking up the entire cabin as opposed to using the toilets The way the bathrooms were being used was terrible as well The crew tried to be as accommodating as possible given the limitations,sazeem,en,1,Very Bad
66,Vile service,Out of touch with customers rude and uncivilised creatures that represent the company as cabin crew lies after lies on why flight delayed Tried to bride with food to keep passangers happy and not asking too many questions The cabin crew should no remorse or apology Would never fly with this vermin company again the parisites are beyond believe,jafar u,en,1,Very Bad
67,Terrible experience poor customer service disgusting,I travelled with PIA on Saturday 14th September 2019 to Islamabad Pakistan via Birmingham UK I can safely say that I will never be travelling with this poor airline EVER again When I boarded the plane my seat was wet I could smell vomit on the seat absolutely disgusting there were crumbs all over the floor and overall the plane was in a poor state and it was clear that it wasnt cleaned from the previous journey The staff who are so rude and think they are above everyone else provide such a poor customer service My mother who travelled with me has sciatica and needed to keep her leg warm so I asked one of the staff for a blanket which they refused and said that blankets are only reserved for children I was absolutely fuming to say the least The food is of poor quality the staff clearly do NOT care about the individuals flying and overall such a poor experience that I am literally boycotting PIA They should shut down and review the service they provide considering that they are representing Pakistan is just horrific Cannot believe they are expanding their aircraft LOL such a joke they need to put customer care first I would give them an overall rating of ZERO if I was able to,Rukhsar B,en,1,Very Bad

74,Executive Economy,PIA has introduced a special upgraded economy class named as EXECUTIVE ECONOMY to enjoy the flight with the facility of BUSINESS CLASS I wonder how dothey call it Facility of Business Class in A320 they have allocated 8 seats as EXECUTIVE ECONOMY there is nothing like EXECUTIVE andor facility of Business class the seats are similar to that of the standard economy class and the unalloted central seat  of a 3 seat row has absolutely no utility One can not relax properly in this arrangement and if you are not travelling with family this is even more difficult to relax Weight allowance is 40KG which is again a funny offer as if you are travelling in standard economy  you can pay 40 SARKG for your extra baggage which will cost you less for your 10 KG extra baggage However the ontime flight shall be appreciated as outbound and inbound flights from Dammam to Islamabad and back to Dammam were exactly on time Food for Executive Economy white rice chicken and also special chicken gravy yougurt and sweet with atin of cold drink was a bit better that than on served in econmy classRice with chiken and ice cold vermicllies only,bfaksa,en,3,Average

96,Surprisingly good service and great food,So i travel frequently with my family and we regularly use Pakistan International Airlines PIA the national carrier for Pakistan This time around we were pleasantly surprised to see very good quality service on board the flight The flight attendants were quite vigilant throughout the 7 12 hour flight and assisted us and my two kids 3 and 6 with smiles on their faces To top it we had execellent quality food served at decent hours during the flight and were spoiled for choice The menu has been increased to options of lamb chicken fish kids and European With British Airways having restarted their service to Pakistan recently and huge numbers of tourists coming into Pakistan I think PIA realized and drastically upped their service a few notches Since the flight is a direct flight between Pakistan and England I would recommend it over and above Etihad Emirates Qatar and all other indirect flights Considering British Airways was not able to take off on time and landed late in London on the day of our PIA Flight and PIA took of and landed as per schedule I would recommend PIA to all incoming and outgoing passengers Be warned though that their is no inflight entertainment however this was not an issue for our family as technology has allowed us to keep our own ipads and smart phones equipped with latest downloaded movies on netflix on the 7 12 hour journey,Babbarali,en,5,Very Good

103,Flight From Hell,I should have written this review years ago but my patience has worn thin PIA used to be the pride of Pakistan and now it is the shame The aircrafts airconditioning system did not function The crew told me the system had been malfunction for months but the ground staff were not willing to deal with it The staff are always busy doing their own thing and at times extremely rude to passengers I witnessed a female attendant leaning on a seat whilst she watched passengers struggle to find space the overhead cabins nodding her head in disbelief at how they were unable to push their bags in to the space available Her tone was rude and her whole attitude was poor I wont blame the cabin crew entirely for their poor performance The problem stems from the way the airline is managed Some of the cabin crew staff have probably worked for the airline since the 80s and 90s They are old school and with so much experience probably complacent that no action will be taken against their poor performance Years ago i was about to board a flight from Islamabad to Manchester and with only an hour to take off a message appeared on the screen suggesting the flight was delayed Hours went by and one bothered to come to the lounge to give any update It was hot passengers were getting impatient and some were become agitated Five or six hours later we discovered the plane bound for Manchester had been rerouted to Saudi to collect Haj pilgrims as their plane had broken down What a shambles i thought to myself What can i say we were left stranded at the airport and finally after a lot of abuse and arguments someone decided to feed people with the poor food that was available in the lounge I have a lot to tell you but I feel its pointless to complain I have written to PIA many times and never received any response Sometimes I feel there is a design behind this madness PIA has been set to fail i feel Why I am not sure Who benefits Again not sure but I do know this Pakistan had many routes Karachi used to be a connecting hub for many airlines and now it isnt Dare I say anymore I caught two chaps smoking in the toilets Went over to the flight attendant and gave their seat numbers No one bothered to come and reprimand the idiots The inflight entertainment system is a shambles 75 hours from Manchester to Islamabad and back no airconditioning and no entertainment Staff never bothered to walk through the aisles and offer drinks instead they let people walk up to the cabin crew and take whole bottles back to their seats leaving little for others,Mohammed S,en,1,Very Bad

122,Absolutely rubbish airline,We are family of six and supposed to be flying on 060419 at 2045 from Oslo to Islamabad via PK772 But theyve cancelled the flight and put us in a really bad situation and worst thing is we have been told to collect the all luggage also which  was nightmare and sent us in to a hotel  About 250 people are effected badly and today is 07th April 19 and still no sign of flight yet I would never choose PIA again at any price If you are flying to Pakistan Please please dont choose pia otherwise theyll put you in a very bad situation Book any other flights apart from pia because other airlines are responsible and have customer care manners Prime minister Imran Khan should privatise or hand over pia to some neutral company,Andy K,en,1,Very Bad

124,PIA Flight Doha to Islamabad,I travelled from Doha Qatar to Islamabad Pakistan at the beginning of March 2019 The flight was fully booked as the airports in Pakistan recently opened after the shut down due to the escalated tensions with India I was surprised to by upgraded to business class since many economy passengers where at the airport hoping to get a seat on chance The travel time was around 2 hours and I really enjoyed the experience The meet and greet by the crew was warm and friendly The leg space and seat comfort was acceptable for the type of aircraft The food menu had mainly local traditional cuisine which was tasty I was interested to experience the new International Airport at Islamabad and found it upto par with international standards I liked the decorations of traditional truck art that are displayed on the walls at the luggage claimI would suggest adding extra toilets for passengers at the luggage claim as there is always a waiting line,OrientalCarpets,en,3,Average
125,PIA realllllyyyy needs to change its menu,It is a big relief whenever a PIA flight is on time There was a lot of turbulence due to bad weather but thats not anybodys fault Their staff is usually courteous The seats of the air bus are highly uncomfortable and the FOOD THE FOOD delivered during flights needdddss a change now It is the same old menu for ages now I dont want it to be lavish but they can at least experiment with some variety,atauqir,en,3,Average
126,Bad experience,I have flown with Pia many times I have yet to experience good service from them The crew have no interest whatsoever in giving that giving a personal touch to them its just a job The plane was ok but the crew let them down The food is just basic with a never changing menuwhen I asked for a second coffee as I dont drink tea they said they had run out of coffee Overall they arent interested in their passengers no service with a smile,Mallah B,en,2,Bad

128,5 Star reviewers working for PIA,They use their monopoly of the direct flight to PK to secure bookings Nobody in their right mind would use PIA if it wasnt the fact of direct flightsDisgusting attitude for flight attendants obviously no training was given around customer service I cannot believe how disrespectful their staff are NO inflight entertainment which is ridiculous for the most expensive flight carrier to PK Their prices are way over the top with service received compared to some premium carriers ie Emirates Etihad Turkish Flown Etihad last couple of times and I must say WOW The service and quality made up for the stopover I would certainly like to help my fellow countryman but you guys need to start treating people a little nicer Maybe just act like human beings Come on PIA I think a revamp of your staff is in order Also you need a Tech team to sort out your inflight entertainmentIf you cant manage that then please start having other carriers flying,Shezzy111,en,1,Very Bad
129,Poor checkin this time average food,It is becoming a dream now to travel with PIA without facing an issue Just two days back I had a very good experience during check in and I explicitly mentioned it in my review This time it was the other way Two of us had three baggage a duffel bag weighing 16 kg a medium size suite case weighing 12 kg and a carton weighing 4 kgs I was carrying a hand carry weighing around 5 kg and my friend was carrying nothing in hand We were told that though our total weight for 2 tickets 32 kg is well within our permissible limit of 40 kg we can only book two items in the baggage We told the person on the counter that the third item is a small carton weighing 4 kg only and that our total weight is well within our authorized limits But the guy kept saying that he can only allow us two bags no matter what the weight And then he came up with a startling solution that my friend who wasnt carrying anything sould carry the medium sized suite case 12 kg as hand carry We tried to tell him that this suite case is well over the permitted weight for hand carry 7 kg and also it is a bit oversized too and may not fit in any of the compartments but he refused to accept our logic and kept insisting that he has to follow rules We finally gave up against his logic and my friend had to carry an oversized over weight case as hand carry The cabin crew rightly so objected to the size and had to make extra efforts to fit it in one of the compartments Withoug being clear on the rules themselves PIA staff nowadays is getting unnecessarily strict on implementing the rules that too their own way We found absolutely no logic in allowing a 12 kg oversized hand carry and permitting two item in the booked baggaged weighing 16 kg and 4 kg respectively when the weight authorization was 40 kg on the pretext that two of us are allowed to book two items only This is poor professionalism  The leg space in this aircraft was very good and we faced no problem on that count There was no arrangement for inflight entertainment The flight time was 1 am the lunch time but we werent provided lunch rather were served with light snacks In the same amount or less other airlines in Pakisan do provide lunch or dinner during domestic flights PIA needs to look into this aspect,flyfisher66,en,3,Average
130,Very average food  beverages,I had terrible experiences during checkin on my last four flights with PIA but this time it was a pleasant surprise I requested for a change of seat and the gentlem said that though none is available but if I wait for 15 minutes he might have a seat I sat in the lounge and in 15 minutes the guy came himself with a new boarding pass having a seat of my choice This was high professionalism and very good customer care Few other passengers also mentioned an improvement in customer service which is heartening  During the flight there was no in flight entertainment As for the food  beverages served the standard was quite mediocre and most of the items served were cheap and ordinary I really feel that PIA charges enough during domestic flights to serve its customers with a decent meals  cup of tea,flyfisher66,en,3,Average

136,Good service but planes need an upgrade which is happening soon I think,I flew with PIA after a decade and was expecting a rubbish experience as the only reason I decided to fly with them was the direct flight British airways starting soon as well btw I was actually pleasantly surprised The staff were really friendly and helpful the food was good as good the plane food can beThe flight was on time and we arrived 10mins before the scheduled time All the tv screens were turned off which I guess is because most of them were faulty so to stop people asking them to fix theirs  they just turned them off I think but most people had their own phones and tablets to use but in the future they definitely need to sort it out which I think they will as theyre buying new planes Ive heardOverall not a bad experience for me especially when I was expecting the worst service possible but I think theyre trying to make an effort lets see,KamranW4,en,4,Good

150,They gave us food poisoning,We arrived in Lahore for a 13 hour layover Against our consent they removed our passports from us and questioned us intently about why we didnt have a transit visa to enter the country After an hour we were escorted to a transit lounge  a room full of metal chairs a water cooler which was bone dry and disgusting toilets at the back Security guards stood at both entrances to ensure we didnt escape We stayed in this room with nowhere to sleep no WiFi and no access to our passports for 13 hours t concerns me most Periodically we were brought food by airlineFinally our time came to be escorted through the airport to our gate We still did not have our passports in our hands they were withheld from us by airline staff We waited at the gate until the final minute finally the airline escorted us to the plane and our seats and handed our passports over  not to us but to the flight attendants We had a short domestic flight to Islamabad and upon attempting to leave the plane with the rest of the passengers we were prevented from doing so It took an hour of the pilot arguing with the ground staff before we were allowed to leave and then we were locked in a bus whilst they disputed our situation until finally driving us to the terminal and escorting us through the airport to the check in gateThis all sounds simple except we were marched back and forth through the airport explaining the predicament repeatedly to staff who appeared to have never managed this situation before Again this flight was booked through PIA so none of this should be news to them Three hours and counting we are forced to pay an airport tax we werent previously told about sent to get our luggage from downstairs and we still do not have our passports Immigration staff argued with us throughout that we should have a visa  we explained repeatedly we have not and will not leave the airportOur final flight departed 2 hours late and news to me stops in Beijing on the way There is no running water on board the toilets dont flush the taps dont run and no one can wash their hands Were delayed in Beijing for 7 hours and the problem is still not fixed Were on the flight I believe for 16 hours in total Cue the worst case of food poisoning I have ever experienced For two days we only ate food the airline provided to us so Im certain it was contracted through PIAs poor hygiene I wont go into the grisly details but I will highlight my point above that there is no running water on this plane I apologise to my fellow passengers for adding to the miseryThankfully after 24 hours i was doing okay and able to move about My boyfriend could not leave the hotel room for 3 days and only after we visited a doctor for an emergency appointment and is prescribed 5 days of antibiotics probiotics and rest is he feeling better Just in time for us to fly home Our return flight isnt much better delays and then a 16 hour layover in Islamabad It gets much worse when after 2 hours of waiting for a staff member our passports were removed from us once more and we were escorted past immigration  against us repeatedly informing that we cannot enter the country we do not have visas all to the response of no come with me I will sort it So we cross the Pakistan border illegally and again no one knows what is going on Were left waiting for 2 hours alone without our passports in the open lounge of arrivals 200 yards from the taxi rank If we had wanted to illegally enter Pakistan which we didnt they sure made it easy for us They keep trying to say we will taken to a hotel again its explained we do not have a visa to be here and its making us nervous Eventually we are escorted back to departures with the aim of getting our boarding passes and some sleep We l are promptly stopped by armed guards We dont have boarding passes or visas therefore we cannot enter We explain that staff brought us past security which they deny The staff blame us stating we entered the country illegally and we should have known better  I suppose we did but not voluntarily and definitely not with any intent We just wanted to be on the next flight homeTwo hours later after the changing of the guard and a tantrum on my part the Big Boss is called and he escorts us through security We are told to wait on two chairs for 8 hours until we can check in We still do not have our passports in our possession and we are not brought anything to eat or drink not that we would have eaten what they brought us Eight hours later and we are finally arguing with immigration again  were forced to pay another airport tax because we didnt have a receipt from the last time  we are reluctantly given boarding passes and allowed through security and escorted to our gate Our passports are finally returnedThe flight home whilst delayed has running water at least however no air conditioning We declined to eat any food they offered and chose to fast instead TLDR The entire experience was a shambles the airline clearly couldnt manage transit passengers and no one knew what was going on We felt like criminals and our passports were removed from us for 1218 hours at a time We got food poisoning from the food and there was no working toiletsrunning water on the flight and we had to access emergency medical attention because of it I wont be flying with PIA again they

175,Its Getting Worst,It was yet another horrible experience I was going on a hunting trip and was carrying my hunting rifle with some ammo which I have done so many times in the past The security guys from ASF inspected the weapon and ammo in detail and recorded everything as per procedure The PIA receptionist on the counter gave me a boarding pass and said that the weapon will be checked and booked by the guy from security department as per procedure which knew very well I waited for the concerned guy for a long time but no one  turned up The lady on the counter kept telling me that he is just arriving After 30 minutes I contacted the supervisor who showed his inability to do anything more than that as it was time for shift change People from old shift were leaving and new shift people had not yet arrived Finally the guy arrived after 45 minutes and took another 15 minutes to book the luggage He inspected the weapon  ammo took his notes and took over my rifle and suite case that carried the ammo in his possession I had to rush for boarding as I had spent over one hour extra on the counter The flight went well without any problem But at Karachi one of the bags didnt arrive I contact the lost and found guys who were quite helpful but were unable to contact the concerned people back in Islamabad for more than an hour as no one was picking up This was horrifying and very nonprofessional I informed them again and again that they must get the whereabouts of the bag as it carries ammo I asked them that weapons and ammo are handled exclusively so how could a bag carrying ammo didnt arrive but they had no reply for this This was pure incompetence and nonprofessionalism on part of PIA staff Finally after more than 90 minutes of waiting I was told that my bag has been found and it was taken down from the flight as it carried ammo I was stunned on this revelation I asked them that they inspected everything recorded it in their record than how could this happen but they had no satisfactory reply for that My bag arrived next day from Islamabad A horrifying experience indeed indicating a very irresponsible attitude My advise for hunters and sport shooters who carry their weapons on air journeys be very very careful when you are traveling with PIA You must reach much in advance because they might take a long time in routine procedures Also make sure that the security guy has done his job recorded everything and also communicated to all concerned otherwise your bag might be taken down from the flight,flyfisher66,en,1,Very Bad

186,Is it the worst airline of the world Yes it is,Yes it is worst airline of the world and being proud Pakistani i feel bad  but this is a fact Our misery started well before our travel date where we were travelling from Australia to KL and then taking PIA to Karachi so flights were well synced however PIA decided to cancel and move our KL to KHI flight about 5 times which stuffed up our further itinerary we had stay in Karachi for couple of days and travelling PIA again to Islamabad however due to international flight changes our domestic keep on changing eventually we had to stay in KL for 2 days to catch PIA flight which we didnt eventually read on but PIA refused to acknowledge any of the issues and told us any other flights are not their concern even domestic PIA because it was our of same PNR PIA booking dont allow stay for 2 days under same PNR and to rub more salt on wound PIA downgraded our flights from Business to Economy WITHOUT LETTING US KNOW  it is a long story but in summary we ended up changing flights 7 timesending up changing our hotel booking in  Karachi 7 times and believe it or not ended up paying for THEIR stuff up in domestic 3 times about 80KKL to Karachi was delayed for more then 180 hours and eventually they adjusted us in Thai no thanks to PIA for that but special thanks to ground staff at KL airport specially shafi sb for their efforts  We somehow reached Karachi 2 days late and Islamabad 4 days late on way back i cancelled all of my PIA flights and waiting for refund from them and yes good luck to me that will be another review AVOID THEM AT ANY COST if you are planning to connect to them from any destination syncing just doesnt work for PIA ,AJ K,en,1,Very Bad

201,AVOID AVOID AVOID,Avoid this cowboy airline unless you want to be humiliated and ill treatedI was due to travel back from Islamabad to Manchester on 030918  We arrived at the airport to be informed that our flight had been cancelled  We received no prior notice of this  The PIA representative at the counter was extremely rude and dismissive and informed us that the flight had been cancelled due to technical issues  He lied and said they had contacted us via phone and email and when we asked for proof he was unable to provide this  We had confirmed our flights 2 days before at Kotli Azad Kashmir and were not made aware of any cancellations  The PIA agents also informed us that the flight got cancelled the previous evening  I feel this is insufficient notice He failed to offer us an alternative flight but rather advised us to contact our travel agent and to go home  The PIA agent then walked away from the counter and another agent replaced him  In total we spoke to about 4 PIA agents before someone actually listened to our concerns  None of your agents were wearing name badges and refused to give us their names one of your agents even started smoking in front of us without being on a break and was on a personal phone call whilst he should have been reassuring his customers  We kept being told to sit and wait  This went on for about 5 hours  Finally we were offered an alternative flight to London and a later flight for the 070918  We refused these options as London airport is 6 hours away from our home address and the flight for the 7th was too late due to school and work  After hours and hours of raising our concerns finally we managed to get the agent to agree a flight for 040918 at 11am to Birmingham our original flight was to Manchester  We were not offered any apology no compensation or travel fare to get us to a hotel  We travelled 5 hours from our address in Pakistan to get to Islamabad airport only to be disappointed and mistreated  We had used all our money thinking we would be going home on the 3rd September  We had to borrow money from relatives who had come to drop us off at the airport  We had to pay further money to arranged overnight accommodation food and then the taxi back to the airport in the morning  Also an expensive taxi from Birmingham to Rochdale which is a 3hour journey I feel absolutely disheartened and extremely upset by the way my family and I were treated by PIA  Their customer service skills are shocking they have absolute no regard for their customers and needless to say I will NEVER use them again,sbashir786,en,1,Very Bad

204,Sadly the only option for a direct flight,For the first time we had a packed agenda for a trip to Pakistan Given the amount of miles that we would cover over the next 2 weeks We choose to fly with the national carrier of Pakistan  PIAAgainst all the advice from family and friends we braved it and managed to find a reasonable price for the flight still could have been cheaper So you could say not a bad start However this also meant that we returned to London Heathrow instead of Birmingham Again not a problem just meant we met up with more family and friendsSo having booked with a reputable travel agent the first issue was that we did not have one single booking The travel agent booked us on 3 different bookings We did not notice this until after the booking was made Credit to the agent they managed to secure us 4 seats all together on all flights or did theyBirmingham departure  things went smoothlyIslamabad arrival and departure New airport  all smooth and thumbs up for a new airport although early days as some of the facilities that were not up and running 100 Karachi departure  things went well as expectedNOW for every single flight PIA had changed all there aircraft Which meant that we were seated all over the aircraft No thought given to the original seat numbers or seating requirement Thankfully we managed to get to the airport early enough to negotiate seating together Albeit this was a mission in itself The staff that we dealt with on each of the counters except Birmingham found it a chore just being at work let alone be bothered to serve a polite request for seating together Sadly this just confirms other reviews of this airlineThe flights themselves were below average The onboard entertainment did not work and on approaching the cabin crew they were honest in there response Which is satisfactory instead of being spun a line on why things do not work The food was again average The assuming thing was that there was 2 adults and 2 children in our travelling party So how did we manage to get 3 different meals served The drinks on the other hand were plentiful and water was always available where this has always been an issue on previous flightsThe general maintenance of the interior of the aircraft is subject to personal opinions You may be lucky to get a sat that actually works ie reclines or you may get an automatic chair that reclines without any intervention from the occupier simply put the seat is broken Unfortunately this is never a good formula especially if the person sitting behind you knows better than you and is not willing to understand In general you travel with PIA with your eyes wide shut The 3 stars are because we managed to overcome most of the hurdles that we were faced with I guess the other point is yes PIA deliver a below than average service but it takes 2 to tango and passengers also have a level of responsibility,Hussainr,en,3,Average

208,From one of the best in the 80s to now one of worst airlines the world a sad decline,I have to fly dont have a choice in the matter with these folks nearly every year and the experience is either just tolerable or bad its just never good With the videos and photos I have taken I will eventually if I have the time write a blog on this Heres a brief list of my recent experiencesEntertainment systems turned off with screens flashing for seven hours so no chance of sleep that the staff wont or cant turn off completely Taken care of by shoving a safety card over it The boxes for these are under the often under the seats so restrict the already meagre leg room If youre lucky the screens are off or its crashed showing you a Linux command line screen with the Linux Penguin in the cornerThe ramshackle seats nearly all worn or broken in some way a cup holder that wont close a snapped off edge of table etcFood tiny portions of food that isnt actually usually that bad But its put luck the breakfast on my recent flight was more like some form of premummification ritual for the passengers every item was dryer than the next so much so it felt like was stuffing some form of dehydration pastry into my mouth and eventually gave up Thats just an exampleInsects in various tray items a whole fly was embedded in the wrapping along with my plastic forkOh and bookings Change a ticket date and theyll do something clever theyll quote you a price So you go on your flight day and theyll just deny that price and set you a new higher one If you argue theyll tell you sit and wait When you realise the dirty game their playing and that they want you to panic as the checkin will close soon you then ask again and they now raise the price even higher they managed get to 80 out of doing this the last time I needed a changeIt all about squeezing every last bit of cash they can from you Heres a good one I need to leave the country early so turned up ready to pay to do so So they had the seats but quoted an exorbitant price however if I came back the next day it would be 13 the price They were banking on it being too difficult for me to come back to the airport but miscalculated as another day for the three of us was not an issue we elected for the following dayHowever the next day it turns out the reissued tickets were wrong theyd made two for me and one for one of the other passengers ignoring the third This was fixed after a fashion but not before rebuking me for not paying attention when buying the tickets odd considering I handed over the three the day before to be modified for the present date to a PIA official it was his mistakeIn flight its pot luck you can have polite cabin crew and on one occasion I even had a good conversation with one But its become progressively worse to the point of crew being openly hostile It is after all the flag carrier of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan so one would think that praying wouldnt be an issue If one can stand for ten times the amount of time it takes pray outside one of their dirty they nearly always are toilets then praying for a few minutes isnt a safety issue or anything KLM their staff praised me for observing my religion quietly and Emirates dont mind However on a recent trip what looked like chief purser became extremely hostile and angry and when I said KLM didnt mind he shouted back well fly KLM then It is hate an anger that he had to a simple request that shocked me and with a few flights to Britain I was flying back home too having been escorted by fighter jetsdiverted due to passengersstaff arguments over the past few years I decided to quietly pray sitting in my seat and avoid the crew My knee was rammed by a hosts trolley later in that flight in what appeared to a deliberate act of retaliation it left my leg so sore that when I took a photo of the swelling a day later it was still visible but realised that any action against them would just be a waste of timeOh checkin This incident I reported to Manchester Airport they palmed it off saying tell the airline which meant give up My wife has a bad back and usually needs assistance in lifting her suitcase onto the checkin conveyor belt However I went to park the car whilst my wife queued On returning I asked the chap manning the head of the checkin queue if I can help my wife he was the same demographic as me born to Pakistani parents but RochdaleBury accented yes I know the difference he told me stand aside and wait so I said in exasperation ok so you want to interview me fine and waited After some time when I asked if I could help now that my wife was now at the check in desk he said no Im banned then I asked he goes yes So I asked him where his station manager was and he pointed to him so I went and asked him The chap stood there and listened but looking past me into the distance this is part of a dehumanising trait common in Pakistan if someone has more influence social status andor money than you To experience it in Britain was quite disgusting He eventually said I could go and help I thanked him and went Now I was just being polite and at airports if youre certain type of person largely based on skin colour one needs to be extra cautious I could have just gone around form where people were exiting with no issue Now I if I need to be there to help a relative I just print off an extra ticket as the chap or chapess manning the head of the queue cant check a tickets validity and in my case it was a chap with a Napoleon complex a receptionist who thinks he own the

240,Never again,Our flight from Birmingham to Islamabad went smoothly but the experience with staff was terrible The check in desk was fine When we got on the plane we were welcomed nicely but when the flight had taken off the staff had taken a totally different turn They walked around with a frown on their faces and were not professional at all The seats were average not exactly comfortable for a 78 hour flightAs a person that suffers from travel sickness I always stay away from the food they offer The air host offered me dinner and I refused politely The same air host started to serve breakfast in the morning and started forcing me to have the breakfast when I had clearly refused Was not happy at all about thatThe last 4 hours of the flight was a nightmare my travel sickness had kicked in There were no sickness bags on the seats close to me and I didnt have a decent bag of my own My father went to ask for a bag and told them there were none at our seatsThey clearly refused saying that there are bags at the seat and didnt give us a bag They saw that I was very unwell and didnt help at all Baggage claim at Islamabad is like always crazy We waited a good 2 hours for our bags and then realised they changed the belt without informing anyoneIt only gets worse from hereNever again PIA,Anila94,en,2,Bad
241,Flight from hell,DO NOT BOOK The service and flight was what I can only describe as horrendous Some of the female staff and one in particular had such a poor attitude as though she didnt want to be there she was rude and unhelpful The plane was one of the really old ones that have like card board seats uncomfortable and clearly not fit for a long haul flight If only PIA had more competition by way of alternative flights offered by other providers maybe that would make them pull their act together In the 20th century I would expect updated seating and facilities on the plane with staff that have manners a trolly of food and drinks people can purchase from is the very basic one would expect on a long haul flight and is offered by many airlines but not PIA if youre lucky they will come around with a bottle of water filling up a tiny paper cup for you The food is disgusting and Im surprised that it meets health and safety standards I couldnt wait to get off the flight and can assure PIA I will never be traveling with them again The amount of money you pay to book a seat with PIA will not meet basic expectations or satisfactory level of service dont waste your money try to book with an alternative airline ,Frankel18,en,1,Very Bad

255,RIGHT ON TIME,When it comes to Pakistan International Airlines a lot of people including locals and foreigners are skeptical to consider it as a travelling option Usually majority of people opt for it after theyve exhausted other alternatives and need to meet certain deadlines To be honest I felt really sad after making these observations If I talk about my most recent flight with PIA I have nothing but praise for this airline My flight was right on time the staff was super courteous food served wasnt bad at all and our captain was able to get clearance from air traffic control to fly via the direct route which meant that we reached our destination earlier than scheduledThe pilot was amazing as he made sure to congratulate a passenger bride on our plane and wish her well for her life ahead One downside might have been the plane being a little oldAs an old passenger whos traveled via this airline multiple times before I have to admit that the standard might have fallen in recent years owing to a few accidents depletion of fleet lack of addition of brand new planes to the fleet and diminishing operational costs But yes there is no doubt that Pakistan International Airlines has some of the best pilots and technical staff in the world I can only hope and pray that PIA can regain that lost trust amongst its loyal passengers and progressively become the airline of choice for most people travelling locally as well as abroad,JHUSOM,en,4,Good

261,A decent airline that needs a bit of modernisation,PIA is mostly used by overseas Pakistanis when travelling to Pakistan because it is the only airline to fly directly there As is with any airline faults can arise Examples that occurred on my latest flight were CheckIn can only be done at the airport for International flight not online Other airlines do the same too for international flights Inflight entertainment did not work on my seats on the outbound journey It has happened on carriers like BASaudi RJ for me Delays  Unavoidable on any airlineThe point of this is that simply calling PIA bad because such things happen is unfair That being said there are issues that need to be addressed eg If the flight is delayed as mine was do not just contact the Pakistani number on the booking also email the customer If a flight is delayed a reconfirmation of the seats should not be requiredThat being said buying my tickets online was easy enough once I had all the information required eg Passport Number Visa Number There should be an option to allow you to input the information later Checkin on the outbound journey to Lahore was easy as our luggage was not overweight Boarding was done in reverse order which made the process easier than normal  I was pleasantly surprised at seeing how much legroom there was Being tall boarding planes of late has been a pain especially with certain airlines continually reducing their legroom Im looking at you BA I was overjoyed that I had ample legroom on a long haul flight The food was good There was also the option of nonspicy food for children however my children took one look and chose the traditional meal instead Customer service from the attendants was good which made my flight a pleasure Based upon my experience on PIA I will definitely use them againPS On an unrelated note sometimes the behaviour of Pakistani passengers can be appalling The way they address the staff is embarassing A little bit of respect can go a long way Why if you want to adhere to all the rules when living in the UK do you throw all that away and regress into uncivilised behaviour,SA312,en,4,Good

275,Overall great experience,I have heard lots of negative reviews about PIA  I chose to fly this one as it gave me the quickest route into Lahore and return  Have to say it was great all the way  Now you have to lower your expectations when you travel a budget airline however it was not a disappointment  Aircraft is clean seats are standard although I must say they are running the newer aircrafts on this route as the interior looked fresher  You get a standard meal soft drinks are offered multiple times along with teacoffeeBets part is you dont have to stop anywhere and change aircrafts so no time wastage its a direct flight which helps save time,patronusstag,en,4,Good

279,Awful Experience rude staff and toilets not working,Decided to travel PIA after 12 years why as its a direct flight and knowing that its going to cause us grief we took the chance1  Lhr to Lahore  flight was cancelled on 15 November the day of travel and we were asked to go on 14 or 16 November2 Lhe to Lhr  flight on 2 Jan was changed to fly out at 130 pm a month before departure no explanation3 Lahore airport  nightmare experience by PIA staff Immigration Customs and porters  everyone yes everyone of them wanted some money just to do their job that is to get us onto the flight  After bribing a few people we were allowed into the departure hall4  The flight was 30mins late departing and 4 toilets werent working it was a full flight At times stewards cleaned the toilets but didnt replace any tissues or toilet rolls  5  I spoke to Asma senior purser who said to provide feedback online to PIA6  I sent in a feedback email to PIA and its day 7 NO REPLY has been received7  Moral of the story PIA Perhaps It Arrives lives up to its name bad seats broke TV sets awful food awful service miserable staff so just take a connection yes it will take longer but you will arrive refreshed8  The officials however will still approach you whether you are Etihad Qatar or Emirates they will always try and get some cash off you  Disgusting,sabiha54,en,1,Very Bad
280,You get what you pay for,A year ago I was returning to China after a short trip to Japan and I picked the cheapest flight I could find PIA While it was cheap that was one of the few things going for it While the actual flight was only 3 hours long we stayed on the runway for 2 hours after its scheduled departure and waited 1 hour on the plane after we arrived in Beijing On top of that the plane seemed a little rickety taking off hoping that it wouldnt break down and all the flight attendants instructions were in Urdu without much English translation But hey at least the airline food was decent,Seth L,en,3,Average
281,Cheap but average service,I traveled to Bangkok from Lahore a couple of months ago After comparing fares of different airlines I found that PIA flight was 15000 PKR cheaper than other options So I chose PIA I have flown with PIA several times in the past and I know their service is just average and my opinion did not change this time Flights were on time comfort and service was OK,Saqib R,en,3,Average

283,Quite good on time large baggage allowance,On time We fly PIA because they are the only airline that do direct flights to Pakistan They also offer very generous baggage allowances 45kg for economy class to Karachi The staff are remarkably polite despite some of the passengers they have to deal with The in flight entertainment system was not working but it was a night flight so we were more interested in sleeping,DrTomShelley,en,4,Good
284,Only recommend due to direct flights,I have used other airlines that stopover in an Arab country but when I just want a faster direct flight 75 hrs instead of 13hrs I use PIA It isnt great but it gets me there quicker The seats are shabby and toilets sometimes run out of water and the staff can be rude Otherwise the food is ok and you get a good baggage limit so that you can take everything your relatives request I hope they update their planes to the dreamliner which will bring them more customers and improve their service overall,imran s,en,3,Average
285,PIA needs to improve its menu,PIA has a lot of negative publicity around it which is not entirely fair The airlines crew is young and friendly and unlike some Gulf Carriers sturn staff are accommodatingI travelled on its 777 which arrived from Malayasia and while there was a 1 hour delay the captain apologized twicegood to see ownershipThere is no in flight entertainment and no giveaways for kidsthis is needed to make it a better airline especially for longer haul flights,Kamakazi786,en,3,Average
286,Cheapest ,there are no bells and whistles but the service is brilliant and food amazing  the only draw back is poor quality of monitors  movies and games if you take your own iPad and can watch movies this is ideal price of tickets is half of other airlines and flight times are ideal no middle of night arrivals or departures ,Waheed Z,en,3,Average
287,Worst Airline to Fly with No doubt,We were coming from Los Angeles to Karachi in Etihad Airways not knowing that from Abu Dhabi Etihad Airways will hand us off to the PIA we didnt have too many options but to wait and see Last time I traveled in PIA was in 2001 and one can already tell that this business will not do well in the future As compare with other airlines they were bad in all categories Unsafe Aircrafts bad customer service and bad food  after a decade found out that this airline went from bad to worst Forget about any internment the feeling in the aircraft was very unsafe on takeoff and landing each and every nutbolt was shaking like they will come out from their sockets and couple of the overhead compartment fell open The instructions on where the life waist is were in English and from God knows which other language The crew didnt give us the embarkation cards and we had to go through the hassle of filling them out on the FBI counterThe food was so bad that though we were hungry from all night we were not able to take another bite of that spoiledcoldbaasifood The socalled shami kababs were halfwrapped in aluminum foil and were COLD the bread tasted stale After reaching Karachi I called Etihad and made sure that we are not going back to Abu Dhabi in PIAI will not recommend anyone to fly in PIA,14mohammad,en,1,Very Bad

293,Hit  Miss,We had an early 715 morning flight so you get up at 430 to get in time to the airport Once there flight cancelled  No email no SMS nothing Weather conditions were perfect so clearly the flight is cancelled because of insufficient travelers After this shocking experience we had a further two flights with PIA and got stuffed around even more PIA has got the monopoly for domestic flights and shows no respect for their customers Competition badly needed ,Dirk W,en,1,Very Bad

298,For domestic travel select PIA for sure,If you are travelling domestic then PIA is no doubt the best Airline that covers almost every region and multiple flights during the day than any other domestic carrierThey need to improve on the meals though as per their airfareStaff is hospitable but not energetic Planes are nicely maintained but needs more attentionThey need to provide inflight entertainment which is not present at the moment,TaimurLateef,en,3,Average

304,Safe and Comfortable,PIA is a Pakistan government owned airline I took the flight on PIA from Toronto Canada to Islamabad Pakistan in December 2017 The flight was direct and took about 12  hours The airline business class was clean and stewards and stewardesses were polite professional and helpful The flight was on time and without any incident The toilets were clean and had all the accessories The food was good and had a variety to choose from My luggage arrived in good condition The seats expands like a bed which allows for a comfortable sleep Since I fly once a year to Pakistan using different airlines I think PIA is very similar to Turkish and Etihad airlines both in service and comfort PIA however is direct and always arrives on time or ahead of schedule I highly recommend this flight,mgtprofessor,en,4,Good
305,Worst nightmares on travelling with pia,Alhamdulillah the best highlights of the flight was the pilot landed in zero visibility and heavy fog without a bump apart from that its the quickest way to get home although the safety and the services on board are questionable the service on the plane was of low standard food in short supply had to keep on asking for services no amusement on board systems failure,madmasai,en,3,Average
306,Dubai Service is Better than,I think this is the best service route of PIA Tickets are reasonable and price fluctuation is non existenceDelays dues to Fog in winters is unlikely due to flight timing    Flight timings suits tourists as the arrival time is 12am and departure time is 1pm at DXB So its easy for a timely hotel checkin and checkoutOverall great value for money,Usman S,en,4,Good

308,Worst Never again,First bad experience was worst delayed flight without notice and then a really old and very very dirty bus was used to transport us to aircraft That was just Okay The food was old and low quality The second time I booked same flight and they booked two tickets in my name I asked them to cancel one as one person can fly on one ticket only They said I have to pay cancellation charges I paid and said goodbye to PIAPIA Never Again,JJJJJ2013,en,1,Very Bad

310,PIA Hopefully never again,Due to a last minute trip decided to book PIA from Paris to Karachi via IslamabadA few hours after the booking was done we recieved a call from PIA to reconfirm the details during the conversation we asked if we could hold our seats The person asked our preference and we said in front of the planeWe were pleasantly surprised to find out that we were given business seats all the way from Paris to KarachiBeing a long haul flight the seats were really handy due to more room and leg space The inflight service was same as economy The staff was not very usefull as i demanded for a blanket 2 to 3 times but they never gave me one during the whole night flight Also they were really not bothered about the passangers and were very loud and noisy throughout the nightOn the way back we tried to pay and get an upgrade but the flight being full wasnt possibleThe way back was the most horrible flight i have ever encountered in my travel historyBeing economy no complaints for the leg space it was alright The flight was overcrowded with infants and children who were screaming and crying all the way throughtout the flight and that which was for 9 to 10 hoursThe flight screens were not working at all  all of them were dead hence there was no inflight entertainment and so couldnt even watch something to avoid all the outside noiseThere was a child aged 79 years of age  seated in the front of my seat who was a complete nuisance I can understand children getting cranky but this one was a compelete pain She was banging the back of her seat with her head and back screaming her lungs out and kicking the seat in front of her due to which her seat was constantly banging and hurting my knees The mother was least bit botheredA horrible way to end a hectic journey was just glad to rush out of the plane PIA hopefully never again,xman7520000,en,2,Bad

312,Needs vast improvement,This ageing airline is just mediocre with fares that are not competitive Ticket prices are ridiculously high When I traveled with them the plane was not clean and the food served was of poor quality As I entered the plane there was a horrid stench The plane felt humid and smelt like someone had vomited The seat felt hard like a rock and did not seem to be maintained at all Some seats were creaky too Scattered all over the plane were handkerchiefs diapers cups discarded tissues and other rubbish on the floor The inflight entertainment system did not work and the content in the few adjacent screens that worked seemed hopeless anyway Most of the LCD screens where not working however A Windows Corrupted message was displayed instead The cabin crew were so unprofessional They dont even speak to you politely I saw a male cabin crew literally yelling at a passenger I requested a blanket but I was told that there are only a few blankets and so I cannot expect to get one Plus if you complain you will never get a proper response One of the expatriate Pakistani passengers sitting close to me was quietly fuming about how foul the smell inside was how filthy the plane was how unpleasant the staff were how despicable the service was and how shocking the customer service at the airline counter was Furthermore Pakistan International Airlines were horrible people to fly with he said The only plus side was that the flight was punctual and on time However this only happens on rare occasions I was told Pakistan International Airlines could do more to improve its service food planes staff and etiquette of its cabin crew,OneBangali,en,2,Bad

319,Another miserable experience,First we were told that the flight will now board at 8 am instead of 10 am It was a minor inconvenience but we made it to the Skardu Airport well in time Around 10 am we were told that the flight from Islamabad to Skardu has been cancelled due to bad weather We asked the airline staff What next Will we be accommodated in the next flight Sorry all flight in next week are fully booked was the reply We were horrified to listen this There were over 100 of us and we had nowhere to go and the only option left to us was to take an 18 hours road journey to Islamabad Many of the travelers got furious and told the airline staff that they have to adjust us in the coming flights but airline staff closed the window and disappeared advising us that we can claim our refund from Islamabad This was absolutely disgusting and I never had such an experience in the past Cancellation  delays in the airflights due to bad weather in Northern Areas of Pakistan is not something unusual and I have experienced it many times in the past However never before PIA abandoned us like this We were always adjusted in the flights on next day or later or were offered a quick refund Many times PIA flies an extra flight on the same day to accommodate the left over travelers It seems to me that now there is no accountability at any level in Pakistan International Airlines Too bad,flyfisher66,en,1,Very Bad

327,There are better options,Its a pretty decent airline and thats about it PIA has been overtaken by airlines like Emirates and Etihad that have far more superior service and a better product overall I have heard they give sometimes better deals than the other Gulf carriers but I think there is a much better experience on any other airline traveling to Pakistan like Emirates or Etihad Seats are relatively comfortable but little variety on inflight meals IFE is kinda outdated and the entire cabin product needs a little fresh update overall Decent airline but there are better options,adss1230,en,3,Average

344,Getting poorer than ever,Our flight was delayed for more than an hour and the airline staff didnt even bother to say sorry They looked absolutely indifferent Last time while traveling from Islamabad to Lahore they sent my luggage and of more than 15 other passengers to Karachi PIA is getting worst than ever I am travelling with this airline since 1981 and in good old days it used to be a very fine airline No more There is something seriously wrong and they are very unprofessional in their conduct They commit and awful mistake and dont even feel sorry about it When I have a choice I do not travel with PIA but unfortunately there arent many options for domestic travel PIA management seriously needs to look inwards and improve their standard in almost everything Their performance is below average in many way,flyfisher66,en,2,Bad

403,Decent onboard service but poor airline product,We hadnt flown with a Pakistanbased airline for a while but we were looking to fly from Lahore to Karachi a domestic route  Each airline serves this route with varying frequency  PIA has the biggest frequency while airblue has the least frequency  Their prices vary as well with SAI and airblue relatively the same price and PIA prices depending on flight time and availability  All of the airlines are fullservice meaning that standard with the ticket are allocated seats checked baggage handcarry baggage and meal  drinks on board  The difference between the airlines are service on the ground their service onboard their safety record as well as their ontime performance  none of the airlines have a reputation which excels at any of these though  For our flight we decided to try PIA from Lahore to Karachi and then SAI from Karachi to Lahore I had previously tried airblue for an international flight   This is my review of Pakistan International Airlines from Lahore to Karachi in April 2016It has been a long time since I had flown with PIA  in fact more than 20 years  PIA had originally been a good airline with decent service and a decent onboard product  As time went by their service ontime arrival and departure and customer service went down  This did not instill a lot of confidence in the airline thus why we stayed away  We decided to give them a try on a quick domestic flight before deciding on whether to fly them internationally Since PIA has been around for a while and they are the national airline they have a lot of resources so they are able to provide more options in terms of flight times  I went online to reserve my ticket and noticed that they had a lot of flight options throughout the day  The flights were operated by various aircrafts and ranged in prices  We had initially booked the evening flight online which was operated by an Airbus A320 but due to technical reasons we could not confirm our flight  We were instructed to go to a travel agency or PIA office for payment and ticket confirmation  When we went to the office we changed to the morning flight to allow us more time in Karachi it was less expensive and it was a chance to experience PIAs Boeing 777  Why a Boeing 777 is being used on a 1hr45 minute flight is a good question  some reasons given were the high demand on the route while other reasons were that this plane needed a technical check and that takes place in Karachi  Whatever the reason we booked a morning flight which was scheduled to depart Lahore at 11am and arrive into Karachi at 1245pm  PIA is a full service airline so when we booked our ticket we were able to select our seats  Our ticket included checked baggage a meallight snack depending on the timing of the flight as well as carryon  PIA does not offer web checkin so we had to go to the airport to deposit our bags and collect our boarding passes  We arrived to the airport early  even though they recommend 2 hours most passengers go to the airport an hour before the scheduled departure  PIA is not known for its ontime departures and even though boarding time was scheduled for 1030am we did not start boarding until almost 1050am  The operating plane was a Boing 777 that was in retro PIA livery and from the outside the plane looked very niceBoarding finally started and we made our way to the plane  On the jet bridge before entering the plane there was a stack of newspaper available for the passengers  The newspapers available were a wide variety of local and international and available in both English and Urdu  When we entered the plane we could immediately tell that 1 this plane did not originally belong to PIA and 2 PIA seemed to have only updated the outside and did very little to nothing on the inside  The plane had belonged to Vietnam Airlines and PIA had not changed the interior  The seats were in the Vietnam Airlines color scheme and patterns  the PTV had either the Vietnam Airlines logo or something written in Vietnamese displayed the information on the back of the tray tables was written in Vietnamese and English and finally there was Christmas music playing on the speakers  The only modifications to the plane PIA had made was the outside paint job and they put PIA seat flaps on each seat  The plane was in a 333 layout and was divided into Business Class Economy Plus and three sections of economy  the entire plane was completely full  The seats themselves were decent and comfortable enough for the short flight but definitely not comfortable for longhaul sector  The seat pitch was average not too tight but not too generous and decent enough for the short flight  The PTVs were very old had small screens and did not work  Half the screens continued to show the Vietnam Airlines logo while the others displayed the flight map  Even when the safety video was screened only the videos on the walls displayed the video instead of displaying on each PTV     The service on the plane was good given the short sector   We were in the economy and as we reached cruising altitude the attendants served a snack  The snack consisted of half a sandwich and dessert  While not a lot it was enough for the short sector  Complimentary soft drinks and juice were also distributed along with the meal  After the meal both tea and coffee were offered  in fact tea and coffee were offered several times   A good aspect was the service on the plane as the flight attendants were constantly in the aisles passing out food or drinks collecting the waste and answering passenger questions regarding PIAs frequent flyer program Announcements were made in both English and Urdu and some interesting items that happened during the flight  when the flight attendant was welcoming the passengers and talking about the plane she mentioned something I had not heard before  She said this is your national airline so please take care of it  That is something I have not heard before and I was not sure if it was something new as a PR or part of their turnaround PIA is going through transition and had recently been through strikes by their worker  The second interesting thing was the Captains announcement  when the Captain came on to talk about the flight he sounded like a newscaster reading out the news  He also spoke for a while as he spoke for a good length in English and then translated everything in Urdu  We landed in Karachi a bit behind schedule and taxied to our gate and deplaned  Overall it was an interesting experience with PIA  I had a lot of hesitation when booking my travel with PIA  they are not known for an ontime departure for their onboard service nor for having updated planes  I experienced some of that not an updated plane but was overall generally pleased with the service on the plane  The service and the experience were decent and good enough for the shorthaul domestic sector but I dont think I would choose PIA for longhaul  From what I have heard others who have travelled internationally on PIA my experience on the shorthaul is similar to the international sector  with decent service but older planes and nonworking PTVs  PIA has some potential but definitely needs some work  Their motto is Great People to Fly With and while it was not a great experience it was better than I

404,Overall Experience,The flight was good and comfortable one but the food and other necessities were just above par We also had a failure of an engine so we had to make an emergency landing in London Heathrow,DaniyalALI,en,3,Average
405,International travel to improve further,Good experience when the journey started at Toronto Pearson as were able to see the waiting lounge in its state of art form It has been thoroughly renovated with nice attractive off white seats and tables with 4 ipads for 4 chairs Very impressive and enjoyable areaBut when it came to the journey on PIA really it was all crowded at the airport Even in the plane it was very crowded and I could hardly get a chance to go to the washroom I wanted to change my seat as it was a window seat with another elderly person sitting who was most of the time sleeping After that I tried to go to the back of the plane but could not sit there as they were not letting us sit and said that it was an old plane and they could not put load on the seats The internet of the plane was not in orderWhen I departed from Lahore to Toronto even then a lot of time is wasted standing in lines at the airport almost 3 hours just a headache and time waste Other airlines do not take that long like Etihad Even in the plane the plane was ok but crowded At the airport the security is not that good as they do not tell you to take off your shoes or jacket They also do not tell you to take out the laptop from the bag while during the screening It would be great if they do the checking thoroughlyWe paid 1040 for the ticket and then again had to pay 350 to change the date of the flight So the ticket actually became 1390 and the return date could not be changed So if we wanted to get that changed we were to pay again almost the same amount 350Why not try some other airline next time The washrooms become dirty and messy soon with tissue paper and water around Sorry to say but People need to behave and be decent while travelling,neelofer,en,3,Average
406,PIA is improving,I have known PIA Pakistan International Airlines as one of the top 10 airlines in the world The services deteriorated over the last two decades I have been travelling a lot lately so I can comment on the services now Recently I have seen considerable improvement in the quality of service I am now in a position to recommend it to others,Salman Q,en,3,Average

410,Not the best flight experience,For Isb to Kchi its still the best airline you can get and its not as bad as you think however if you think about all the rest of airlines in the world its pretty poorI have been on theis flight 3 x I loiked it when they served biryani but the other two times they served a sandwich that I think was stale bread,Ryan A,en,2,Bad
411,Terrible flight,I booked this flight Dubai to Islamabad in February 2016 It was terrible to fly with PIA The staff is extremely rude the fare of the flight is so high the food is very bad planes are not clean The PIA staff did not uploaded my luggage in the plane including the luggage of 30 other passengers and we came to know on the baggage claim in Islamabad that our luggage was not uploaded The PIA authorities told that it will arrive in the next flight but it did not instead it was sent to the flight going to Karachi from Dubai after 3 days When I checked it with the airport I came to know that we were not the only who faced this difficulty but there was a store of PIA full of baggages of passengers that reached Islamabad after several days from Abu Dhabi Dubai Jaddah and other origins However my baggage was retrieved after facing a great difficulty on the 12th day of my arrival in Islamabad,Bushrakhalid,en,1,Very Bad
412,very very very poor,very poor standards from check in to arrival Flew from Manchester to Karachi via Lahore The plane stank a mixture between a curry chefs armpits and an open sewer Food was ok The inflight entertainment was a joke in that only 1 screen out of 3 worked PIA were much better on the domestic LHE  KHI route with the new A320s that are now in service Had to clear customs in Lahore and check back in for domestic flight PIA misplaced my baggage on the domestic route It arrives 10 hrs later which caused me a lot of issues as I had a wedding to attend the same evening To PIA  my predicament seemed a joke,israrshah,en,1,Very Bad
